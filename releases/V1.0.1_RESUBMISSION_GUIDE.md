Version 1.0.1 - Critical Bug Fix

Fixed: Version 1.0.0 incorrectly launched a console window instead of the system tray application.

v1.0.1 now correctly displays a system tray icon with right-click menu for overlay management.

Users who installed v1.0.0 will automatically receive this update.
```

### Step 5: Add Note for Reviewers (Optional)
1. At bottom of submission page, look for **Notes for certification**
2. Copy and paste this text:

```
This is an emergency fix for v1.0.0 which was published on 2025-10-30 but contains a critical bug (launches console window instead of GUI tray app).

v1.0.1 fixes the packaging to include the correct GUI executable. All functionality is identical, only the entry point changed.

No dependency changes. Assets and manifest already compliant with previous approval.
```

### Step 6: Submit
1. Review all sections (everything else should remain unchanged)
2. Click: **Submit for certification** at bottom of page
3. Confirmation screen will appear
4. Click: **Yes, submit**

## ‚è±Ô∏è WHAT TO EXPECT

**Certification Timeline:**
- Automated checks: 5-10 minutes
- Manual review: 1-3 business days
- Bug fixes often get expedited review

**After Approval:**
- New downloads get v1.0.1 immediately
- Existing v1.0.0 users receive auto-update within 24 hours

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before clicking Submit, confirm:

- [ ] Uploaded file: `EFMapHelper-v1.0.1.msix` (1,300 KB)
- [ ] Old v1.0.0 package removed from list
- [ ] Release notes updated with bug fix explanation
- [ ] Version shows as 1.0.1.0 in package details
- [ ] All other sections unchanged (Properties, Pricing, etc.)

---

## üîç WHY THIS HAPPENED

**The Mistake:**
- Two executables exist: `ef-overlay-helper.exe` (console) and `ef-overlay-tray.exe` (GUI)
- Both are ~2.3 MB (full applications with identical functionality)
- Testing used Debug build of tray.exe ‚úÖ
- Packaging script accidentally referenced helper.exe ‚ùå
- Both file sizes similar, so no obvious warning
- Never tested the actual MSIX package before uploading

**Prevention:**
- Always test Release builds before Store upload
- Extract and run MSIX on clean VM
- Verify executable name in manifest matches expected entry point

---

## üìû IF CERTIFICATION FAILS

**Possible issues:**
1. **"Crashes on launch"**
   - Response: Tray apps have no visible window by design
   - Provide screenshot of system tray icon

2. **"Missing dependency"**
   - Response: Already disclosed in v1.0.0, reference approval date

3. **"Unclear release notes"**
   - Expand explanation: "v1.0.0 launched console.exe instead of tray.exe"

**Always respond within 24 hours to keep submission moving**
