## Part 2: Prepare Store Assets

You'll need to create these assets for the Store listing:

### Required Screenshots (at least 1, up to 10)

- **Resolution:** 1366x768 minimum (1920x1080 recommended)
- **Content:** Show the overlay in action:
  - Screenshot 1: Route navigation overlay on starfield
  - Screenshot 2: Mining telemetry display
  - Screenshot 3: Helper tray icon and settings
  - Screenshot 4: ef-map.com integration

**How to capture:**
1. Launch EVE Frontier with overlay running
2. Use Windows + Shift + S to capture regions
3. Save as PNG files

- **Content:** The EF-Map logo (can extract from helper resources)

### Promotional Images (Optional but Recommended)

- **Hero image:** 1920x1080 (shown on Store homepage if featured)
- **Poster:** 1080x1920 (portrait orientation)

## Part 3: Build and Upload MSIX Package

### Build the Package

```powershell
cd C:\ef-map-overlay\packaging\msix
.\build_msix.ps1 -Version "1.0.0" -BuildConfig "Release"
```

2. Click **"Start your submission"**
3. Navigate to **"Packages"** section
4. Drag and drop `EFMapHelper-v1.0.0.msix`

### Notes to Certification Team

**CRITICAL:** Add this note to help certification understand the DLL injection:

```
This application uses controlled DLL injection to render DirectX overlays within EVE Frontier.

Technical details:
- Injection only targets "exefile.exe" (EVE Frontier client)
- Uses standard hooking techniques (Microsoft Detours pattern)
- No modification of game files or memory manipulation
- Similar approach to Discord overlay, OBS, MSI Afterburner
- Open source for full transparency

Purpose: Displays player-owned routing data from ef-map.com as in-game HUD elements.

This is NOT a cheat or mod - it only displays information the player already has access to through ef-map.com, presented conveniently in-game.
```

## Part 5: Submit for Certification

1. Review all sections for completeness:
   - ‚úÖ Packages uploaded
   - ‚úÖ Properties filled
   - ‚úÖ Age ratings completed
   - ‚úÖ Store listing with screenshots
   - ‚úÖ Pricing set to Free
   - ‚úÖ Notes to certification added

2. Click **"Submit for certification"**

3. Wait for review (typically 1-3 business days)

## Part 6: What Happens Next?

### Scenario A: Certification PASSES ‚úÖ

1. You'll receive email: "Your app is in the Store"
2. App appears at: `https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/[app-id]`
3. Update ef-map.com "Install Helper" button to point to Store link
4. Users install with one click, full Windows integration works
5. **Microsoft signs the package automatically** - no more Defender warnings!

### Scenario B: Certification FAILS ‚ùå

Common rejection reasons:

**Reason 1: DLL Injection Policy Violation**
- Microsoft may consider injection a security risk
- **Response:** Appeal with detailed technical explanation
- Emphasize: Open source, read-only overlay, similar to Discord/OBS
- If appeal fails: Fall back to ZIP distribution or SSL.com signing ($249/year)

**Reason 2: Incomplete Metadata**
- Missing screenshots or unclear description
- **Response:** Update submission with requested changes and resubmit

**Reason 3: Crashes During Testing**
- Tester doesn't have EVE Frontier installed
- **Response:** Add note that EVE Frontier is required for full functionality
- Ensure helper gracefully handles missing game

## Part 7: After Approval

### Update Your Website

Update `DEFAULT_DOWNLOAD_URL` in your web app:

```typescript
// Before (GitHub Releases)
const DEFAULT_DOWNLOAD_URL = 'https://github.com/Diabolacal/ef-map-overlay/releases/latest';

// After (Microsoft Store)
const DEFAULT_DOWNLOAD_URL = 'ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=[YOUR_PRODUCT_ID]';
```

### Monitor Reviews

- Check Partner Center for user reviews
- Respond to feedback
- Update app based on common issues

### Updates

To release v1.1.0:
1. Build new MSIX: `.\build_msix.ps1 -Version "1.1.0"`
2. Partner Center ‚Üí Your app ‚Üí "Update"
3. Upload new package
4. Submit for recertification (usually faster than initial review)

## Troubleshooting

### "Package validation failed"

Check:
- Publisher name in manifest matches Partner Center
- Version number is higher than previous submission
- All capabilities are declared correctly

### "App crashes during certification"

Add to notes:
- "EVE Frontier must be installed for full functionality"
- "Helper runs in system tray even without game"
- Provide logs showing graceful degradation

### Alternative Path: Microsoft Store for Business

If consumer Store rejects due to DLL injection:
- Try **Microsoft Store for Business** (enterprise distribution)
- Less strict policies for developer tools
- Requires company account instead of individual
