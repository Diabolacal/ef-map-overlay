# Privacy Policy for EF-Map Overlay Helper

**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025

## Overview
The EF-Map Overlay Helper is a desktop utility that provides in-game overlay functionality for EVE Frontier. This application does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect any personal data.** The helper application:
- Does NOT track your activity
- Does NOT collect analytics or telemetry
- Does NOT store personal information
- Does NOT transmit data to third-party services

## Local Processing
All functionality operates locally on your computer:
- Route calculations are performed locally
- Game state detection happens on your device
- No data is sent to external servers except voluntary requests to ef-map.com for route data

## Communication with EF-Map.com
The helper may communicate with ef-map.com (the companion web application) solely to:
- Retrieve star map route data when you request it
- Synchronize your current in-game location for navigation features

These communications are initiated by you and contain only the minimal information needed (system IDs, route waypoints). No personally identifiable information is included.

## Open Source Transparency
This application is open source and available for inspection at:
https://github.com/Diabolacal/ef-map-overlay

You can review the source code to verify our privacy commitments.

## Technical Capabilities
The application requires elevated permissions (`runFullTrust` capability) to:
- Inject overlay rendering into the game process (similar to Discord, OBS, or other overlay tools)
- Access DirectX rendering pipeline for displaying information

These permissions are used solely for overlay functionality and do not enable data collection.

## Your Rights
Since we do not collect personal data, there is no user data to access, modify, or delete.

## Changes to This Policy
We will update this policy if our data practices change. The "Last Updated" date will reflect any modifications.

## Contact
For questions about privacy or this application, please contact:

- Website: https://ef-map.com

## Summary
**Bottom line:** This helper app processes everything locally, doesn't collect personal information, and only communicates with ef-map.com when you ask it to fetch route data. It's open source so you can verify this yourself.
