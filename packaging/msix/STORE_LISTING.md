# Microsoft Store Listing - EF-Map Overlay Helper

## Description (Main)
Enhance your EVE Frontier experience with real-time in-game overlays for navigation and telemetry. EF-Map Overlay Helper seamlessly integrates with the companion web app at ef-map.com to display route information, visited systems, navigation waypoints, DPS tracking, and mining statistics directly in your game window.

Calculate multi-jump routes on the web map, then see them rendered as an overlay while you fly. Track which systems you've visited during your session, monitor your current location, and never lose your way across the vast frontier. View real-time combat DPS graphs and mining efficiency (m³/min) to optimize your gameplay.

Works alongside EVE Frontier without interfering with gameplay. Open source and privacy-focused—all processing happens locally on your computer with no data collection or tracking.

Perfect for explorers, miners, combat pilots, and anyone who wants better navigation and performance tools without alt-tabbing.
